# description
This was a project for The Odin Project. The application is set up using React and Vite. The idea was learning how to use useState in conjuction with useEffect. On load 20 images are fetched from unsplash API and displayed in a random order. Each time the user clicks an image all the images are shuffled and the scores are updated. If the use clicks an image for the second time the game is over and the scoreboard is updated accordingly.
